# Clay

![Clay logo](resources/Clay.svg)

Clay is a REPL-friendly Clojure tool for a dynamic workflow of data visualization and literate programming.

It also offers a set of tools to integrate Clojure literate programming with the [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) publishing system.

## Getting Started

Check out [Get Started](https://scicloj.github.io/clay/#getting-started) to get started!

## Docs

More details may be found in the [Documentation](https://scicloj.github.io/clay/). In particular:
* See the [API](https://scicloj.github.io/clay#api) and [Configuration](https://scicloj.github.io/clay#configuration) subsections for more options and variations.
* See the [Setup](https://scicloj.github.io/clay#setup) section and recent [Videos](https://scicloj.github.io/clay#videos) for details about integrating Clay with your editor so you do not need to call `make!` yourself.

## Related projects

The [Claykind](https://github.com/timothypratley/claykind) project is rethinking the Clay architecture and implementation from scratch, in a new code base. Currently (Fall 2023), the two projects are being developed in coordination.

[Kindly](https://scicloj.github.io/kindly-noted/kindly) is a common ground for defining how things should be visualized, seeking compatibility across tools.

[kindly-advice](https://scicloj.github.io/kindly-noted/kindly_advice) is a library that helps tools such as Clay to be Kindly-compatible.

[kindly-render](https://github.com/scicloj/kindly-render) is a library for rendering kinds to different taget formats. In the near future (as of Nov. 2024), Clay should rely on it.

[read-kinds](https://github.com/scicloj/read-kinds) is used internally by Claykind (and soon by Clay as well) to generate Kindly advice from notebooks expressed as Clojure namespaces.
